What I want right now is top-level contexts
[ ] The only topics I want showing up on the context list page are top-level
    Do I need to maintain a lookup table?
    I should store top-level info on the table
    def DataWrangler::DocumentTypes::Context.is_top_level?
        looks for a field
        if it doesn't find it, calculates and sets field
    `get 'context_list/all'` calls a DataWrangler function
        It should call a DataWrangler::DocumentTypes::Context function 
        This function should then only retrieve top-level records
[ ] A topic is top-level when it's not part of any other contexts
[ ] I also want to be able to have multiple topics with the same names, just under different top-level contexts
[ ] If a top-level context param is not given, it should go to a "disambiguation" page
[ ] data_wrangler controllers should not be calling DataWrangler methods directly.
    Needs to be a mapping layer?
    Route -> Controller -> Model
    What is a model in DataWrangler?
    One "model" exists, UrlsToRead
    Is intended to be a wrapper around Sequel
    Right now contexts are "unstructured"
    Need path for unstructured tables to become models
    What are the steps to turn unstructured tables into models?
        1 - Make model
        2 - Make migration
        3 - Existing app should work

App -> RestResources -> [ DocumentTypes | DataWrangler ]
Need to make similar API for Unstructured as for Models
RestResources should not care whether it's backed by a Unstructured Table or a Model
